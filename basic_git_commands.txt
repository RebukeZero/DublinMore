This file assumes that you have the git repository cloned onto your local machine. From
that it will start you on the master branch. Checkout a branch with:

git checkout <branch_name>

Pull (update) a branch with:

git pull <branch_name>
Note: git pull will update your current branch, if you want a specific branch that you
aren't currently on,

git pull origin <branch_name>

To view changed files since the last commit:

git status

To add changed files to a local commit:

git add <file_name>
Note: git add -A or git add --all will add all changed files to the commit.

To make a local commit to the repo:

git commit -m "<commit_message>"
Note: Generally the commit message describes the files that were changed and the change
themselves.

To push your branch to the remote server for the first time:

git push -u origin <branch_name>

After you push it for the first time, you can just push it after you're finished with it:

git push

Creating a branch:

git checkout -b <branch_name>

General sequence goes:
git checkout -b <branch_name>
git push -u origin <branch_name>
Make changes
git status (if you want)
git add -A or specific files
git commit -m "message"
Repeat adds and commits as needed
git push when done

When a branch is done, open a pull request on github and compare your current branch
with dev. Have others code review it and make necessary changes.
